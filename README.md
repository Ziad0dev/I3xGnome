* lightDM (recommended) or GDM with Wayland disabled

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Ziad0dev/I3xGnome.git
cd I3xGnome
sudo make install
```

### From Packages

#### Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
# Download the latest .deb from Releases
sudo apt install ./i3-gnome_1.3.0-1_all.deb
```

#### Fedora/RHEL
```bash
# Download the latest .rpm from Releases
sudo dnf install ./i3-gnome-1.3.0-1.fc*.noarch.rpm
```

#### Binary Installer
```bash
# Download the binary installer from Releases
chmod +x i3-gnome-1.3.0.run
sudo ./i3-gnome-1.3.0.run
```

### From GitHub Packages (Docker)

```bash
# Pull the container image
docker pull ghcr.io/ziad0dev/i3xgnome:latest

# For a specific version
docker pull ghcr.io/ziad0dev/i3xgnome:1.3.0
```

## Usage

1. Log out of your current session
2. At the login screen, click the session selector (gear icon)
3. Choose "I3 + GNOME" from the list
4. Log in

You'll now have i3 as your window manager with GNOME services running in the background.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues (like the session failing to start or crashing immediately), follow these steps:

### 1. Run the Diagnostic Script (NEW!)

This comprehensive diagnostic script checks for common problems and provides detailed recommendations:

    ```bash
# Run the diagnostic tool
    /usr/bin/i3-gnome-diagnose.sh

# Or if running from source directory before install:
./session/i3-gnome-diagnose.sh

# For verbose output:
DEBUG=1 /usr/bin/i3-gnome-diagnose.sh
```

The diagnostic script will check:
- Required dependencies and their versions
- GNOME compatibility and configuration
- Graphics driver setup (especially NVIDIA)
- Display manager configuration
- D-Bus connectivity and GNOME services
- Environment variables and session setup
- Recent error logs and system status

**Always run this first** - it will identify most common issues and provide specific fix recommendations.

### 2. Check Logs

    After a failed login attempt, switch to a working session or TTY (`Ctrl+Alt+F3`) and check the systemd journal:

    *   **System Log:** `journalctl -b 0 -p err` (Look for errors from `gdm`, `nvidia`, `drm`, `gnome-session`)
    *   **Session Log:** `journalctl --user -b 0` (Look for errors from `gnome-shell`, `i3xGnome`, `gsd-*` components)

    Focus on messages timestamped around the time of the failed login.

### 3. Common Issues & Fixes

#### **NVIDIA GPU Crashes (Most Common)**

This is the most frequent cause of crashes. The improved version includes several fixes:

*   **Automatic NVIDIA Detection**: The diagnostic script detects NVIDIA GPUs and checks configuration
*   **Proper Xorg Configuration**: Use the included `20-nvidia.conf`:
    ```bash
    sudo cp 20-nvidia.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf
    sudo systemctl restart gdm  # or lightdm
    ```
*   **Disable Wayland in GDM**: Edit `/etc/gdm3/custom.conf` (or `/etc/gdm/custom.conf`):
    ```ini
    [daemon]
    WaylandEnable=false
    ```
*   **Switch to LightDM** (Recommended for NVIDIA):
    ```bash
    sudo apt install lightdm
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm  # Select lightdm
    sudo reboot
    ```
*   **Enable NVIDIA DRM Modeset**: Add to `/etc/default/grub`:
    ```
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="... nvidia-drm.modeset=1"
    ```
    Then run: `sudo update-grub && sudo reboot`

#### **Missing Dependencies**

The enhanced version includes comprehensive dependency checking:

```bash
# Install all required packages
sudo apt install i3 gnome-session gnome-settings-daemon dbus-x11 xrdb
```

#### **Session Registration Failures**

The improved version includes retry logic and graceful degradation:
- Automatic retries for D-Bus operations
- Timeout handling to prevent hanging
- Fallback to standalone mode if GNOME Session Manager is unavailable

#### **Environment Issues**

The enhanced scripts now automatically:
- Validate the graphical environment
- Set proper XDG environment variables
- Check D-Bus connectivity
- Wait for required services to be ready

### 4. Debug Mode

For detailed troubleshooting, enable debug mode:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
DEBUG=1 gnome-session-i3

# Or for the launcher script
DEBUG=1 i3-gnome --debug
```

This will provide verbose logging to help identify issues.

### 5. Reporting Issues

If you continue to have problems after running the diagnostic script, please open an issue on the GitHub repository. Include:

*   Your Linux distribution and version
*   Your GNOME version (`gnome-shell --version`)
*   Your graphics card and driver version (`nvidia-smi` if applicable)
*   **The complete output of the diagnostic script**: `/usr/bin/i3-gnome-diagnose.sh`
*   Relevant error messages from `journalctl`
*   Steps you have already tried

# i3xGnome Setup

This configuration provides a setup for running i3 window manager sessions integrated with GNOME components.

## Tested Environment

*   **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (or latest desktop version)
*   **Display Manager:** LightDM 1.30.0 (recommended) or GDM with Wayland disabled
*   **Graphics:** NVIDIA (tested with RTX 3060, Driver 550+), AMD, Intel

## NVIDIA Configuration

For optimal compatibility, especially with NVIDIA drivers, use the included Xorg configuration:

```bash
sudo cp 20-nvidia.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf
sudo systemctl restart gdm  # or lightdm
```

This configuration includes:
- Proper NVIDIA driver settings
- AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration for multi-monitor setups
- Optimized settings for i3 + GNOME integration

## Quick Start

1. **Install**: `sudo make install`
2. **Run Diagnostics**: `/usr/bin/i3-gnome-diagnose.sh`
3. **Fix Any Issues**: Follow diagnostic recommendations
4. **Test Session**: Log out and select "I3 + GNOME"

## Testing

You can test i3xGnome without logging out using several methods:

```bash
# Quick component validation (30 seconds)
make test-quick

# Full component testing (1 minute)  
make test-components

# Nested X session testing (2-3 minutes)
make test-nested

# Full test suite
make test
```

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing documentation.

## Getting Help

- Run the diagnostic script first: `/usr/bin/i3-gnome-diagnose.sh`
- Use the testing framework to validate changes: `make test-components`
- Check the troubleshooting section above
- Enable debug mode for detailed logging
- Report issues with diagnostic output included
